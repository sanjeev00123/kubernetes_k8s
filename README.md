## kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling and management of containerised applications. It allows the efficient management of clusters of containers, handling tasks such as scaling based on resource needs, automated rollouts and rollbacks of update and self healing of containers.
##  Why do we use Kubernetes ?
            
### Scalability:- 
it allows applications to automatically adjust resources to maintain performance without manual intervention.
### Fault Tolerance:- 
Kubernetes enhances applications reliability through automated health checks,self-healing capabilities that replace failed containers and intelligent distribution of traffic across healthy instances.
### Resource Efficiency:- 
by optimizing resource utilization and workload placement, kubernetes helps in achieving cost savings and maximizing hardware utilization.
### Container Orchestration:-
Kubernetes automates the management of containers, simplifying the deployment, scaling and operational tasks associated with containerized applications.
### Portability:- 
Kubernetes provides a consistent platform across various environments enabling applications to run identically on-premises, in the cloud, or across hybrid and multi-cloud setups.
## Components of Kubernetes

## What is kubectl ?
kubectl is the command-line interface (CLI) tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to perform various operations on Kubernetes resources, such as pods, services,deployments, and more. kubectl communicates with the Kubernetes API server to execute commands and manage cluster resources. Users can create, inspect, update, and delete.Kubernetes objects using kubectl, as well as perform tasks like scaling deployments, viewing cluster logs, executing commands inside containers,
port-forwarding, and managing configurations. It is a versatile tool that plays a crucial role in managing and operating.Kubernetes clusters efficiently from the command line.
